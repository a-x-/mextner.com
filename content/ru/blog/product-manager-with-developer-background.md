Being a Product Manager with a strong developer background is often a double-edged sword. On one hand, it's a huge advantage. Your deep technical understanding allows you to communicate effectively with engineering teams, make informed decisions, and grasp the complexities of the product you're building. You can empathize with developers, anticipate technical challenges, and even roll up your sleeves when needed.

But is it always a good thing? Some might argue that too much technical expertise can be a double-edged sword. You might find yourself tempted to dive into the code, which can distract from your primary role of setting the product vision and strategy. Additionally, your team might rely too much on your technical knowledge, potentially stifling their growth and innovation.

The key is balance. Use your technical background as a tool to enhance your product management, but don't let it overshadow your strategic thinking. Remember, your role is to focus on the "why" and "what," while the engineering team handles the "how."

At the end of the day, a strong developer background can be a powerful asset‚Äîif you know how to leverage it effectively. üõ†Ô∏èüí°
