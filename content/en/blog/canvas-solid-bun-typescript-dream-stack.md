I’ve been diving deep into Canvas for rendering, experimenting with Solid.js for its fine-grained reactivity, exploring the speed of Bun. This combo feels like a powerhouse, but I’m curious:

* Do you use these tools in your stack?
* What’s your favorite combo, and why?
* Or maybe you think there’s a better, underrated alternative?

Let’s geek out about what’s shaping the future of web development.

Drop your thoughts below – I’d love to hear your perspective!
