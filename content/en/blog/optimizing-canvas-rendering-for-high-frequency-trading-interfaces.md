🚀 Ever struggled with UI lag when your trading interface is flooded with real-time data? Here’s how we tackled it.

### The Problem

When every widget triggers its own requestAnimationFrame (rAF), multiple rAF calls stack up and execute in the *same frame*. This overloads the 16ms budget, causing dropped frames and a janky UI. Worse, widgets compete for resources, and low-priority tasks steal time from critical ones.

### The Insight

A unified rendering loop (like in game engines!) batches all rendering tasks into a single rAF iteration. Instead of widgets fighting for control, the loop processes them sequentially, respecting the frame budget. If a widget takes ≤5ms to render, multiple can be handled per frame. No changes? The loop sleeps.

### Key Technical Wins

✅ **Time Slicing with "Units of Work":**

Break rendering into chunks that fit within the frame’s remaining time. But it’s not just splitting work—it’s about:

- **Prioritization:** Critical tasks (e.g., hovered widgets) go first.
- **Dynamic Allocation:** Adjust chunk size based on device performance (weak vs. powerful machines).
- **Time Budgeting:** Track elapsed time and pause if the frame is “full”.

*(Want to dive deeper? Look into game loop patterns or React’s scheduler for similar concepts. While our code isn’t open-source, the principles align with incremental rendering and cooperative multitasking.)*

✅ **Avoiding rAF Pitfalls:**

Calling rAF multiple times queues *all* callbacks for the next frame. A shared loop ensures only one batch runs per frame, preventing task avalanches.

✅ **Prioritization System:**

1. Cursor-active widgets (e.g., dragging a chart).
2. Visible elements (what the user sees *now*).
3. Background/outdated widgets.

### The Result

From 10+ widgets fighting for a frame to 6+ rendered smoothly in 16ms. Users get silky-smooth interactions even during data spikes.

### Why It Matters for Trading UIs

Latency isn’t just annoying—it costs trust (and money!). A unified loop ensures the UI stays responsive, no matter how fast the data flows.

💡**Think Like a Game Developer:**

Games use a single loop to update physics, AI, and rendering. Adopting this mindset for trading interfaces unlocks similar performance gains.
