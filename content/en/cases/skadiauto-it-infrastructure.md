## The Challenge

SkadiAuto needed to establish a complete IT department and infrastructure from scratch to develop professional Tesla diagnostics software. The project required building a team capable of reverse-engineering proprietary protocols, developing complex software tools, and creating a professional brand identity for the automotive diagnostics market.

## My Role

**My Role:** Hands-on development, team building and hiring, architecture design, technical leadership, strategic planning.

## The Solution

We led the complete IT transformation:

* **Team Building:** Recruited and hired 10 engineers with expertise in embedded systems, reverse engineering, and software development
* **Infrastructure Setup:** Built entire IT infrastructure including development environments, CI/CD pipelines, and secure systems
* **Protocol Reverse Engineering:** Led the team in decoding binary protocols for Tesla vehicle communication
* **Brand Development:** Created comprehensive branding strategy and visual identity for the product
