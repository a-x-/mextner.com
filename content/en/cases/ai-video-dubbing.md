## The Challenge

The platform needed to build a scalable AI platform capable of dubbing videos into multiple languages while maintaining lip-sync accuracy and natural voice quality. Client required processing thousands of hours of video content for major media companies including streaming services, educational platforms, and content creators.

The startup needed comprehensive consulting to implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for improving translation quality, redesign the UX for better user experience, optimize the existing codebase, and establish efficient development processes. Implementing **collaboration tools** for the its clients.

## The Solution

We provided comprehensive technical leadership and architecture design:

* **AI/ML Architecture:** Designed pipeline combining speech recognition, neural translation, voice synthesis, and lip-sync technologies
* **Scalable Infrastructure:** Built distributed processing system handling concurrent video processing at scale
* **Quality Assurance:** Implemented automated quality checks and human-in-the-loop validation
* **API Development:** Created robust APIs for enterprise clients to integrate dubbing into their workflows
* **RAG Implementation:** Designed and integrated RAG system for context-aware translation improvements
* **UX Redesign:** Complete overhaul of user interface for intuitive workflow management
* **Codebase Optimization:** Refactored legacy code, improving performance by 3x
* **Process Improvements:** Established CI/CD pipelines, code review practices, and agile workflows

## Technologies Implemented

* **LLM/RAG:** Open Web UI, Claude Code, MCP Servers for development and business
* **Infrastructure:** AWS ECS based multi stage pre-deployment
* **Support and Monitoring:** Logrocket, Chatwoot, Slack integration

## Results

* Platform now serves 50+ enterprise clients globally
* Processing capacity of 50,000 hours of video monthly
* 99.9% uptime for enterprise SLAs
* Achieved industry-leading quality metrics for AI dubbing
